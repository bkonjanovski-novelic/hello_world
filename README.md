**Exercise 1: Variable Practice**

Create a new project called `variables_practice` and write a program that:  
1. Declares an immutable variable with your age  
2. Declares a mutable variable for your favorite number and changes it  
3. Uses shadowing to convert a string to its length  
4. Prints all values

**Exercise 2: Type Exploration**

Write a program that demonstrates:  
1. All integer types with example values  
2. Both floating-point types  
3. Boolean operations (true/false, and, or, not)  
4. Various characters including emoji

**Exercise 3: Tuple Calculator**

Create a program that:  
1. Stores three numbers in a tuple  
2. Destructures the tuple  
3. Calculates and prints the sum, average, and product of the numbers

**Challenge Exercise: Student Records**

Create a program that uses tuples to store student records:  
1. Create 3 tuples, each containing: (name, age, grade_average)  
2. Print a formatted table of all students  
3. Calculate the average grade of all students  

**Bonus:** Use arrays to store multiple tuples and iterate through them.
